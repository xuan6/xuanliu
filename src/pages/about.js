    <h3>Xuan Liu (she/her) </h3>
    <h4>Design Engineering | Amazon Device Design</h4>
    <p>People often call Xuan Designer by title, but Xuan focuses more on the Engineering side in a nutshell. If you are looking for a typical UX/UI Designer who is passionate about drawing wireframes and visually appealing mockups, you might want to back up and make a u-turn</p>
    <p>While typical designers spend days making creative crafts, Xuan reviews design from the technical lens, systematizes designs with engineering patterns, and builds scalable, component-based design systems to facilitate design and development process.</p>
    <p>Xuan brings design to life with proof of technical feasibility, scalability, accessibility, and localization compatibility. Xuan is also experienced in exploring short-term alternatives and long-term strategies to meet design intents under technical constraints and tight timelines.</p>
    <p>Working closely with product and engineering teams makes Xuan an efficient collaborator and communicator. Xuan guides product teams to identify and apply reusable patterns and create products with consistency. Xuan also partners with engineering teams through documentation, office hours, and code reviews to ensure the parity between design and development.</p>
