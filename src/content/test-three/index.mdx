**[Technical Design]** 

granular level - how to technically structure and realize the UI for a specific use case, considering all the risks and limitations, to make the UI functional and feasible

- eg. how to realize a card UI on the home page

小：细节实现、How to 针对单一场景从设计到开发的技术转化 functional和feasible

**[System Thinking]** 

hight level - **systematic, set up UI logics to handle how to scale and react to changes under different scenarios and contexts** 

- eg. how to realize a set of card UI on home and settings across mobile, tablet on iOS and Android

大：系统化、怎么变，在不同场景下有逻辑地变化和应用

- from a singular scenario to a robust system
- from one device to more
- from one tech stack to more

**[Communicator] 【cross function collaboration 怎么做出来、沟通打磨、advocate and socialize，讲behavior故事？】**

- [System] **Identify** opportunity → systematize and structure designs into reusable development ready building blocks and templates
    - Find opportunity → componentize designs with engineering patterns → booster efficiency, do right things
        - identify and abstract reusable building blocks from design
            - eg. card → image + group of buttons → button and image view should be reusable across the system, otherwise it is expensive and hard to maintain
        - system evangelist
            - **frame design patterns** or
            - **leverage** existing patterns
            - catch custom designs that could conflict with or break existing design system
            - investigate solutions to realize custom designs that are not supported by existing system
                - custom font style, italic, not in existing design library package → custom override

- [Technical+System] **Govern** details→ gate keeper, foresee limitations and concerns, focus on details, do things right
    - interaction flow (not block flow)
        - component states
        - page empty states
    - feasibility
        - explore viable solutions without compromising design intent
        - hardware - motion, rendering
        hardware chips are the cheapest you can find plus 10% off, not apple chips, motion design is limited
        - software - performance
        - platform - realize a same set of designs cross platform
            
            how to realize design on different platforms with different technologies, also how to address different technical challenges and risks
            
            <aside>
            💡 eg. shadow的实现: iOS 原生、安卓 elevation、自带的frame或者9patch、APL的局限
            
            </aside>
            
    - scalability - future proof - how to react when things change
        - content (too much content → truncation or scroll & empty state)
        - localization - enough space to grow, future proof
        - device screen size - set up logic, bounding box
    - accessibility
        - font size
        - color contrast
        - touch target
    - compatibility
        - fallback platform version (iOS SVG support - use PNG or PDF, Android animation support)
    - consistency
        - cross platform (iOS Android, available on A but limited on the other, go or no go)
        - cross product family (same component, different behavior, bad design)
